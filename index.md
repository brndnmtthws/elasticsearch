# Getting Started

This framework requires:

* A running [Mesos](http://mesos.apache.org) cluster
* The use of <a href="https://github.com/mesosphere/marathon">Marathon</a> is strongly recommended to provide resiliency against scheduler failover.

# How to build

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./gradlew build
{% endhighlight %}

Alteratively:

* Use [gdub](https://github.com/dougborg/gdub) which runs the gradle wrapper from any subdirectory, so that you don't need to deal with relative paths
* Use [Docker](#building-with-docker)
* Use [Docker-Machine](#launching-a-docker-machine-vm)

# How to build scheduler and executor Docker containers

This describes how to build and launch a local instance of mesos, with the Mesos Elasticsearch project installed. If you want to build and run the containers natively, then skip the docker-machine step.

## Launching a docker-machine VM

If you want to run docker-compose in a virtual machine (for example you are on a mac, where the native mesos libraries don't work), then you can use docker machine.

* Install docker-machine: https://docs.docker.com/machine/#installation
* Create a virtual machine: `$ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox dev`
* Export the environment variables so you can communicate with the docker daemon: `$ eval "$(docker-machine env dev)"`

Docker-compose will connect to the VM docker daemon that was exported above.

## Building the code

The docker containers for the scheduler and executor are not built by default:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./gradlew build docker
{% endhighlight %}

## Building the containers

Build only the scheduler or executor Docker container:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./gradlew :scheduler:docker
$ ./gradlew :executor:docker
{% endhighlight %}

## Launch locally with Docker Compose

We recommend that you use docker-machine to test the Mesos Elasticsearch project locally. Users that do not want to use docker-machine, please ensure your Kernel supports overlayFS.

Build the project as described above, then run the docker-compose scripts with the following commands:

{% highlight bash %}
$ cd system-test/src/test/resources/mesos-es
$ docker-compose up
{% endhighlight %}

Now open the browser at http://localhost:5050 to view the Mesos GUI.

NOTE: If you run docker from a VM (boot2docker on OSX), use the ip address assigned to the VM instead of localhost:

{% highlight bash %}
docker-machine inspect dev -f "{{.Driver.IPAddress}}"
{% endhighlight %}

The Elasticsearch task can be accessed via the slave on port 9200. Find the IP address of the slave: 

{% highlight bash %}
$ docker ps # Check the container ID of the slave
$ docker inspect <ID> |  grep IPAddress # Find out the slave IP
{% endhighlight %}

Now open the browser at http://SLAVE_IP:9200 

When you are done with docker compose kill the containers and remove everything:

{% highlight bash %}
$ docker-compose kill 
$ docker-compose rm --force -v
{% endhighlight %}

## How to install on Mesos

{% highlight bash %}
$ deploy-executor.sh
$ deploy-scheduler.sh
$ deploy-cloud-mesos.sh
{% endhighlight %}

These scripts transfer the jars and the cloud-mesos zip to the master node. Also, the <i>executor</i> jar and 
cloud-mesos are put in HDFS onder /elasticsearch because they are used to launch the elasticsearch task. Now you can SSH
into the master node and run the <i>scheduler</i>

{% highlight bash %}
$ java -jar elasticsearch-mesos-scheduler.jar -m MASTER_IP:5050 -n 3 -nn MASTER_IP:8020
{% endhighlight %}

## How to install on Dcos

If you have followed the steps described in "Full steps to build on Mac" then  to deploy execute the following steps.

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./deployDcos.sh --master=MASTER_IP
{% endhighlight %}

Replace `MASTER_IP` in `--master=MASTER_IP` with a reference to a host recognisable by your `ssh` command.

## How to find the Mesos master on AWS

1. Open Mesos website
  * Get the DCOS public DNS, 
  * Copy it into another browser instance and
  * Use port 5050 by adding at the end of the DNS public address :5050.
This will show the Mesos website for your instance
1. Select from the Mesos website the 'Slaves' view
1. Make node of all the 'Hosts' (slave hosts)
1. In AWS Services select 'EC2'
1. In the lefthand side menu select 'Instances'
1. Find the instance with a 'Public DNS' which is not any of the ones belonging to the slaves and which belong to the DCOS installation
  *  An instance belonging to the DCOS installation should have a 'Security groups' with a name that contains the word DCOS
1.  The 'Public DNS' for that instance is what you need to ssh (run the deploy script)

## How to install on Marathon

Run the deploy.sh script from the root directory to install all the components. Now change to the scheduler folder and run 

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./deploy-to-marathon.sh 
{% endhighlight %}

This scripts loads the marathon.json file and runs the scheduler in a container on one of the slaves. Note that it 
requires host networking.

## How to import demo data

The [Sharekespeare dataset](http://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/3.0/import-some-data.html) from Elastic.co can be
imported with the [mwldk/shakespeare-import](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/mwldk/shakespeare-import/) Docker image.
Just point the `ELASTIC_SEARCH_URL` environment variable at one of your Elastic nodes.

{% highlight bash %}
$ docker run --rm -e ELASTIC_SEARCH_URL=http://${MASTER_IP}:9200 mwldk/shakespeare-import
{% endhighlight %}

## Alternative ways of building

### Building with Docker

{% highlight bash %}
$ docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:rw \
      -v ~/.gradle/:/root/.gradle/:rw \
      -v `pwd`:/app:rw pierrevincent/gradle-java8 build
{% endhighlight %}
